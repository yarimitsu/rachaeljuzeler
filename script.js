            description: "ReConstructed ReFuse: Air, Sea & Landscapes was created for the Municipality of Anchorage Public Art Program in 2024/25. This immersive installation consists of eight large mosaics, a suspended herring net and three mobiles, created almost entirely of waste glass, mainly kiln fired recycled bottles and old windows.\n\nThe first four mosaics, overhead as you enter the building, depict seascapes filled with to-size king and sockeye salmon, herring and jellyfish, all created from window glass reformed in a kiln. Walking up the entry stairwell, there is a net filled with glass herring on the left reflecting in the sun. At the landing, the mosaics continue and move up the stairwell, into a creek and landscape scene with spawning salmon, birds, and other signs of wildlife.\n\nThe pebble tesserae in the creek scene are made of crushed bottle glass; the leaves, wildlife and other objects, of fused bottle and sheet glass, mixed with reclaimed tile tesserae. With the exception of a few art glass details, the mosaic tesserae is entirely reclaimed, reused and waste glass transformed in the kiln. The final piece of this installation are the mobiles hanging overhead in the entrance. Flying glass herring and small murrelet-type birds made of embellished and fused sheet glass float above with shimmering wings of reused window screen.",

As my artistic mentality revolves around the reworking of waste materials, I realized I needed to acknowledge the abundance of plastics in our environment. After many trials, I developed a way to spin twine from single-use plastic bags, creating a visually appealing material, and started using it in my work, creating nets and \"weaving\" with the twine.\n\nI find beauty and inspiration in natural patterns.

Each individual herring is made from multiple layers of cut and embellished scrap window glass which is kiln fired into its final form. The herring laden nets are strung between mosaic strips of reclaimed tile, mirror and beach rust and are suspended from reclaimed fishing line.\n\nThe flying glass herring and hooligan are outfitted with plastic wings made from clamshells from grocery store greens and are mounted in front of my \"H2O quilt\" paintings created in both oil on board and kilned art glass mounted on board.",
