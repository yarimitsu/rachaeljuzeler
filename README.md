### Adding New Project Images

2. Put your project images in that folder
3. Open `index.html` and add a new work item following the same pattern
4. Open `script.js` and add your project info to the `projectData` section

## Your Image Files

All your project images are stored in the `images/` folder:
- Each project has its own subfolder (e.g., `images/project1/`, `images/project2/`)
- Your headshot is at `images/rjuzeler.jpg`
- Keep images under 1MB for faster loading
- Square images work best for the main grid

## Publishing Your Updates

When you make changes:

1. **Save your files** after editing
2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Use GitHub Desktop app, or
   - Use the GitHub website to upload changed files
3. **Your website updates automatically** within a few minutes

## Important Files

- `styles.css` - Controls how your website looks (colors, fonts, layout)
- `script.js` - Makes the image galleries work
- `images/` folder - All your photos and artwork
- Each `.html` file - A page on your website

## Getting Help

**For simple text changes:** Any text editor works (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)

**For more complex updates:** Contact your developer or consider hiring a web developer familiar with HTML/CSS.

**Website hosting:** Your site is hosted free on GitHub Pages and updates automatically when you upload changes.

## Backup

Your entire website is backed up in this GitHub repository. Download the whole repository periodically to keep a local backup of all your files.

## Future Enhancements

There's a Python content management tool (`rachael_content_manager.py`) included in the files that could make updates easier, but it needs testing and setup before use. This could be a future improvement to make managing your portfolio even simpler.
